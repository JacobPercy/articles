    "summary": "Reynolds said the illegal dumping of waste - described by one farmer as \"a travesty of justice that surely must be righted\" - was an issue that had been \"seized\" by the prime minister, with more resources being given to the Environment Agency.",

    "summary": "But before EU leaders rush to change the rules, they need to know more about the reasons for the delays.\nBut necessary detail\u2014 such as the relative impact of different factors \u2014 is lacking, and EU leaders need that information before they act.\nEU rules say that proposed green-hydrogen plants need to be powered by new sources of renewable energy, to incentivize the development of more renewable-energy facilities.\nAs a next step, researchers could ask the same question, but model only renewable energy as the green-hydrogen power source \u2014 as required under the existing EU rules.\nResearchers can help by devising ways to ensure that green hydrogen is produced sustainably, while not unduly hampering the technology\u2019s adoption.",

    "title": "A Candle-Powered Light",
    "summary": "For a little over two thousand years, the primary light sources after the sun had set were oil lamps and candles.\nThis was well before the age of fossil fuels, so these oil lamps were often fueled with a labor-intensive agricultural product like olive oil.\nLabor and materials costs aside, though, there\u2019s a surprising amount of energy in these fuels and [Maciej Nowak Projects] has a generator that help these ancient light sources generate some electricity on the side.\nThe generator is based around a piece of technology called a thermoelectric generator (TEG), which produces a voltage potential when placed in a temperature gradient.\nIt would make a fitting addition to anyone\u2019s emergency power outage kit as it really increases the amount of available light produced from any given candle.",

    "summary": "Kohler claims its new Anthem EvoCycle smart shower system can deliver \u201cup to 80% water savings\u201d without the use of showerheads that limit flow or pressure.\nPricing starts at $7,500, or $5,625 with discounts, but you\u2019ll need to buy fixtures and the $825 water tank base separately.\nSwitching to \u201cCycle Mode\u201d mixes a half gallon of that fresh water with dirty used water that\u2019s sent through a closed loop filtration system before being pumped up to the showerhead.\nThe system not only reduces water usage, but it can also potentially reduce energy usage by using the hot water heater less.\nThe EvoCycle smart shower connects to Kohler\u2019s mobile app so you can track water savings and activate a self-cleaning mode.",
