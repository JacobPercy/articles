    "summary": "President Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2026 Thursday with measures that further the bipartisan push for next-generation nuclear power plants.\nThe Trump administration has embraced the technology as a new energy source for data centers demanding greater amounts of electricity for AI.\nMany Democrats, meanwhile, have championed smaller and ostensibly cheaper and easier-to-build nuclear reactors as a carbon pollution-free energy source that can help fight climate change.\nThe International Nuclear Energy Act establishes working groups and boosts funding and interagency cooperation on the development and export of US nuclear technologies.\nThe bill also directs the Department of Defense to create an executive agent role \u201cfor installation and operational nuclear energy.\u201d",

    "summary": "But today grid operators increasingly value pumped hydro plants as workhorses able to mediate highly variable wind and solar assets.\nPumped hydro plants could help to solve this problem but building them has often been expensive and difficult.\nVast reservoirs and towering mountains, historically associated with pumped hydro projects, may no longer be essential.\nThe IHA estimates that 600 GW of pumped hydro projects are in the global pipeline.\nOne project that helped boost that total was the 3.6 GW pumped hydro plant in Fengning, China.",
