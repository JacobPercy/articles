    "summary": "That might not sound much, but the UK's seas are now considerably warmer than even a few decades ago, a trend driven by humanity's burning of fossil fuels.\nThat is contributing to major changes in the UK's marine ecosystems, with some new species entering our seas and others struggling to cope with the heat.\nScientists and amateur naturalists have observed a remarkable range of species not usually widespread in UK waters, including octopus, bluefin tuna and mauve stinger jellyfish.\nThat is making marine heatwaves more likely and more intense.\nThe precise distribution of marine species varies from year to year, but researchers expect the UK's marine life to keep changing as humans continue to heat up the Earth.",
