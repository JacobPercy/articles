    "summary": "U.S. energy prices are expected to continue to go up next year, according to new data from the Energy Information Administration.\nWhy are rising energy costs concerning?\nFor Americans already dealing with higher prices for things like groceries and rent, higher energy costs are a punch in the gut.\nOne way to help protect yourself from rising energy prices is to invest in solar.\nTCD's Solar Explorer is a great resource to help you make sense of all the options available.",
