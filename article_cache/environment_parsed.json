    "summary": "While climate change is known to make marine heatwaves more likely, scientists are struggling to explain why the north Pacific has been so hot for so long.\n\"There's definitely something unusual going on in the north Pacific,\" said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.\nSo removing that cooling effect in shipping hotspots like the north Pacific could be revealing the full impact of human-caused warming.\nAnd a warm north Pacific appears to have different effects later in the winter, favouring milder and wetter conditions in some parts of Europe.\n\"But since the La Ni\u00f1a is quite weak this year, the extreme warmth in the north Pacific could be more important for forecasting the winter ahead.\"",
