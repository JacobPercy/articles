    "summary": "Smoke billowing from the blazes has blanketed central Canada and the northern U.S., prompting widespread air quality alerts.\nIn the U.S., the National Weather Service (NWS) has issued air quality alerts across the Midwest and Northeast.\nThe Switzerland-based air quality monitoring database IQAir\u2014which provides real-time air quality data\u2014listed Minneapolis, Minnesota, as having some of the worst air pollution in the world over the weekend, the Associated Press reported.\nAir quality alerts indicate that air is unhealthy for sensitive groups, including people with asthma, lung or heart disease, children, and older adults.\nThat said, wildfire smoke can affect anyone\u2019s health, regardless of their age or preexisting conditions.",

    "summary": "Two satellite missions on the chopping block have provided climate scientists, oil and gas companies, and farmers with critical atmospheric carbon data for years.\nTrump\u2019s budget proposal threatens both missions, but the standalone OCO-2 would be completely destroyed during its fiery descent through Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThe OCO-2 and OCO-3 sniff out atmospheric carbon dioxide using spectrometers to detect wavelengths of light absorbed by CO2 molecules.\nThis instrument has also provided valuable insights into urban carbon dioxide emissions and contributed data that supported the Paris Agreement.\nWhen plants absorb sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into energy, their chlorophyll\u2014a light-absorbing pigment\u2014leaks some unused photons, JPL explains.",

    "summary": "As such, if the finding is successfully rescinded, EPA will have actively and intentionally walked away from its responsibility to address climate change.\nBut in addition to being crafted by five known climate contrarians, the report is riddled with climate denial tropes, cherry-picked evidence, and distortions of the indisputably well-established facts on climate change.\nSharply cutting those emissions is crucial to limiting dangerous climate change.\nHundreds of scientists have come together to write major globally relevant reports, including the U.S. Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5) and the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (AR6), documenting the latest science.\nLost homes, rising insurance premiums, unhealthy outdoor working conditions, business interruptions and damaged infrastructure are all effects of a worsening climate.",

    "summary": "Last week, it announced a plan to revoke the endangerment finding.\nStill, in taking on the endangerment finding, the Administration has managed to outdo itself.\nThe attempt to rescind the endangerment finding combines pandering to the fossil-fuel industry with another of the Administration\u2019s favorite activities: flouting science.\nAt this point, repealing the endangerment finding on scientific grounds should be impossible: contra the claims of the D.O.E.\nRescinding the endangerment finding could \u201cbackfire on the fossil fuel industry,\u201d Parenteau observed.",
