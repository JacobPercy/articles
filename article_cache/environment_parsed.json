    "summary": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Inside Climate News:\"Each year, global emissions become increasingly concentrated among a shrinking group of high-emitting producers, while overall production continues to grow.\nSimultaneously, these heavy emitters continue to use lobbying to obstruct a transition that the scientific community has known for decades is essential,\" said Emmett Connaire, senior analyst at InfluenceMap.\nThe findings of the new analysis, he added, \"underscore the growing importance of this kind of rigorous evidence in efforts to determine accountability for climate-related losses.\"",
