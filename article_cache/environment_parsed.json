    "summary": "Climate change Air quality Pollution See all topics FollowDozens of veteran climate scientists are launching a coordinated response to a Trump administration report that casts doubt on the severity of climate change.\nThe scientists, responsible for authoring or contributing research to hundreds of peer-reviewed studies, want to counter what they interpret as the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to wipe credible, widely accepted climate science off the record.\n\u201cDecades of climate research and data have yielded expanded understanding of how greenhouse gases affect the climate,\u201d NAS president Marcia McNutt said in a statement.\nSeveral climate scientists whose research was cited in the Trump report said it misused or misrepresented their work.\n\u201cIt\u2019s giving me flashbacks to 2005, when such false debates raged.\u201dCobb said she hopes to help \u201cset the record straight\u201d on climate science in their response to the DOE report.",

    "summary": "For nearly 30 years, the International Space Station has played orbital home for astronauts from all over the world, but its time is running out.\nSlated to retire in 2030, NASA is aiming to replace it with a privately-run station that can host its astronauts in space when needed.\nIn a memo signed August 4, Duffy directs NASA to revise its Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destination program, which is designed to facilitate the development of commercial stations to replace the ISS.\nAnother major change is the revision to minimum capability requirements for an ISS replacement.\n\u201cHow was NASA\u2019s previous strategy for commercial stations going to work when they lost close to a third of their budget?\u201d Phil McAlister, previously the director of NASA\u2019s Commercial Space Division, said in an interview with Ars Technica.",
