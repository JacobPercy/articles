    "title": "New law on more sustainable, circular and safe batteries enters into force",
    "summary": "A new law to ensure that batteries are collected, reused and recycled in Europe is entering into force today.\nThis will support the shift to a circular economy, increase security of supply for raw materials and energy, and enhance the EU\u2019s strategic autonomy.\nThe Batteries Regulation will ensure that batteries placed on the EU single market will only be allowed to contain a restricted amount of harmful substances that are necessary.\nBackgroundSince 2006, batteries and waste batteries have been regulated at EU level under the Batteries Directive.\nSuch exponential growth in demand for batteries will lead to an equivalent increase in demand for raw materials, hence the need to minimise their environmental impact.",

    "summary": "Mercury pollution from coal plants has been tied to serious neurological problems, especially in children and babiesOn Friday the Trump administration officially rolled back a series of Biden-era environmental regulations on coal plants, including some intended to clamp down on mercury pollution.\nThose earlier rules allowed power plants that burned a particularly dirty form of coal called lignite coal to emit more mercury than plants that burned other forms of the fossil fuel.\nThe move is the latest in a string of actions by the Trump administration to prop up what has long been viewed as a moribund coal industry in the U.S.\nThe administration has ordered the Department of State to run military facilities on coal power, funded renovations for coal-powered plants and even blocked plants from shutting down.\n\u201cAnd once again, the Trump administration is doing so at the expense of people\u2019s health.\u201dCoal-fired power plants are the leading source of mercury emissions in the U.S., according to the EPA.",

EPA that greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, qualified as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.\nWhen contacted by Scientific American on Wednesday, the EPA declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing a long-standing practice of not commenting on current or pending litigation.",
