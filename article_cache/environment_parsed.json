    "summary": "A watchdog group that monitors publicly-available environmental data has recorded 70 percent more federal website changes during Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office in 2025 compared to the start of his first term in 2017.\nThat includes changes to content, like replacing the term \u201cclimate change\u201d with \u201cextreme weather,\u201d and the wholesale removal of entire webpages.\n\u201cThe thing that is the most different is this total erasure of information about environmental racism and the evidence of environmental racism,\u201d Gehrke says.\n\u201cThat story is yet to unfold.\u201d So far, the EPA\u2019s climate change website is still intact.\nFarmers and environmental groups have also filed suit to force the Trump administration to restore federal resources.",
