    "summary": "Smoke billowing from the blazes has blanketed central Canada and the northern U.S., prompting widespread air quality alerts.\nIn the U.S., the National Weather Service (NWS) has issued air quality alerts across the Midwest and Northeast.\nThe Switzerland-based air quality monitoring database IQAir\u2014which provides real-time air quality data\u2014listed Minneapolis, Minnesota, as having some of the worst air pollution in the world over the weekend, the Associated Press reported.\nAir quality alerts indicate that air is unhealthy for sensitive groups, including people with asthma, lung or heart disease, children, and older adults.\nThat said, wildfire smoke can affect anyone\u2019s health, regardless of their age or preexisting conditions.",

    "summary": "Two satellite missions on the chopping block have provided climate scientists, oil and gas companies, and farmers with critical atmospheric carbon data for years.\nTrump\u2019s budget proposal threatens both missions, but the standalone OCO-2 would be completely destroyed during its fiery descent through Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThe OCO-2 and OCO-3 sniff out atmospheric carbon dioxide using spectrometers to detect wavelengths of light absorbed by CO2 molecules.\nThis instrument has also provided valuable insights into urban carbon dioxide emissions and contributed data that supported the Paris Agreement.\nWhen plants absorb sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into energy, their chlorophyll\u2014a light-absorbing pigment\u2014leaks some unused photons, JPL explains.",
