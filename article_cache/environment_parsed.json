    "summary": "Since then, the United States has moved to assert control over Venezuelan oil exports, the country's main source of revenue, seizing tankers it says were transporting crude in violation of U.S. sanctions and signaling plans to redirect Venezuelan oil to global markets under U.S. oversight.\nVenezuela's oil reserves are thought to be the largest in the world at an estimated 300 billion barrels.\nAdvertisement AdvertisementAdvertisement AdvertisementEven a modest increase in Venezuelan oil production could carry climate consequences on the scale of entire countries, said Mahdavi, of the University of California, Santa Barbara.\nHe said Venezuela\u2019s heavy oil reserves lie in fragile plains crisscrossed by slow-moving rivers, a geography that can magnify the effects of spills.\nThe true environmental and social costs of Venezuela\u2019s oil have never been fully calculated, de Lisio said.",
