    "summary": "Odds for another interest rate cut jumped Friday after New York Fed president John Williams signaled he could support a cut when the central bank meets in December.\nThough he still sees room to cut, Williams said he believes tariffs have temporarily stalled progress toward the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation goal.\nHe estimates tariffs are contributing a half a percentage point to three-quarters of a percentage point to inflation.\nRead more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investmentsAlso on Friday, Fed governor Stephen Miran said that if he were the marginal vote on whether to cut rates, he would vote for a 25 basis point rate cut instead of the 50 basis point cut he favors.\nMiran noted that he thought the September jobs report would tip anyone who wasn\u2019t sure whether to cut rates toward doing so.",
