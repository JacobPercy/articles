    "summary": "This post contains spoilers for \"Greenland 2: Migration.\"\nHowever, \"Greenland\" differs from the usual disaster movie formula by telling a genuinely harrowing story that explores how humanity would react to, and suffer from, a catastrophic event.\n\"Greenland 2: Migration\" continues to showcase the bleaker side of disaster fare \u2014 and it's even more brutal than its predecessor.\nDirected by Ric Roman Waugh from a script by Chris Sparling and Mitchell LaFortune, \"Greenland 2: Migration\" combines disaster movie thrills with post-apocalyptic savagery.\nOn paper, \"Greenland 2: Migration\" sounds like every other post-apocalyptic disaster movie.",
