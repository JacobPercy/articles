Edwards wrote that the nonprofit groups \u201care unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim,\u201d since the information the agencies are sharing isn\u2019t covered by the IRS privacy statute.\nStill, two separate court orders have blocked the agencies from massive transfers of taxpayer information and blocked ICE from acting upon any IRS data in its possession.",
