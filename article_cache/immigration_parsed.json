Ellis of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois said during a hearing Thursday morning that she would require ICE agents in Chicago engaged in \u201cOperation Midway Blitz\u201d to use body cameras.\nBut the logistics of enforcing her order are yet to be worked out, since Chicago was not included in earlier ICE body cam programs, and the government shutdown might complicate acquiring and issuing new equipment.\nAgents have been repeatedly documented using aggressive tactics, arresting elected officials, and have been spotted wearing face masks and no identifying badges while detaining people on the streets.",
