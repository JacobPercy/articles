    "summary": "Hence, exposure to full spectrum lighting results in a balanced pattern of improvement in visual performance.\nThese three features change the way in which long wavelength light may be applied to improve human physiology by delivery in normal environments with lasting balance effects.\nWhen shorter wavelength exposure is dominant, as in LED lighting, mitochondrial function declines.\nRetinal metabolism declines with age, but this can be partly corrected with long wavelength light across species16,21.\nConsequently, it has been suggested that longer wavelengths reduce water viscosity around rotary ATP pumps allowing the rotor to increase speed27.",

    "summary": "Canopy is KFI Studios and Gensler\u2019s answer, a freestanding workstation that behaves like a tiny room inside the open plan.\nIt combines a height-adjustable desk with an upholstered privacy hood, integrated lighting, and built-in power, creating a personal haven for focused work without walling people off.\nThe upholstered hood softens the hum of the floor, integrated lighting dials in for your screen, and the sit-stand surface adjusts to your height with intuitive controls and a digital readout.\nThe fully upholstered hood gives a sense of boundary without feeling like a box.\nBy giving each person a small, height-adjustable, well-lit, and acoustically softened bay, it brings a bit of architectural calm into the open plan.",
