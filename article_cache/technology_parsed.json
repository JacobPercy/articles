    "summary": "According to the Financial Times, the breakthrough came after Huang\u2019s visit to the White House on August 6 to meet with President Donald Trump.\nTo prevent this, the U.S. has imposed strict export controls, blocking the sale of top-tier AI chips to China.\nThe Power of Personal DiplomacyReversing this policy took months of intense diplomacy and lobbying, culminating in Huang\u2019s personal visits to the White House.\nDuring a White House AI summit last month, Trump admitted he had initially considered taking antitrust action against the chip giant before he got to know its CEO.\nWith the $8 billion revenue threat now averted and the $50 billion China market reopened, investors will be watching closely when Nvidia reports its quarterly earnings later this month.",
