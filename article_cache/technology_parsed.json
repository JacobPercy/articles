    "summary": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is consolidating below $90,000, but BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes says the pause masks a powerful liquidity-driven move that could send the cryptocurrency to $200,000 in 2026.\nWhat Happened: In his latest essay, \"Love Language,\" Hayes argues the Federal Reserve's newly introduced \"Reserve Management Purchases\" (RMP) program is effectively a rebranded form of Quantitative Easing (QE).\nIn that environment, he believes hard assets such as Bitcoin and gold are the most effective hedges against currency debasement.\nHe also argues the traditional four-year Bitcoin cycle has been replaced by a \"permanent\" cycle of debt monetization.\nPrice Target: Hayes expects Bitcoin to reclaim $124,000 before accelerating toward $200,000 in 2026.",
