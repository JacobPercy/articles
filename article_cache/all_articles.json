      "summary": "One of those systems was the Bulletin Board System, or BBS, which would have been a single computer, often in someone\u2019s home, connected to a single phone line.\nThe video by [The Retro Shack] sets up a lot of this history for context, then, towards the end, uses a modern FPGA-based recreation called the Commodore 64 Ultimate to access a BBS called The Old Net, a modern recreation of what these 80s-era BBS systems were like.\nOnce there, users can access mail, share files, and even play a few games.\nA retro machine like a C64 or Atari is not required either; modern operating systems can access these with the right terminal program, too.\nA more in-depth guide to the BBS can be found here for those looking to explore, and we\u2019ve also seen other modern BBS systems recently.",
