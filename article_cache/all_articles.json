      "summary": "Investment firms are on track for an enormous payday after the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) struck down President Donald Trump\u2019s signature tariff policy on Friday.\nWhen Trump introduced sweeping tariffs on foreign goods last April, hedge funds and specialist investment firms began to bet on the possibility that the courts might rule that he had violated the law.\nEven then, he says, the administration may choose to challenge any lower court ruling that requires the government to refund tariff payments.\nThe prevailing uncertainty leaves the investment firms holding refund claims with a dilemma: Should they bank some winnings by flipping the claims to another buyer, or wait out the legal wrangling?\n\u201cTrump is Trump is Trump, man,\u201d says Braziel.",
