      "summary": "In those days, China itself was receiving aid from the Soviet Union, says Carrie Dolan, an expert on Chinese health aid at the College of William and Mary.\nChina framed its foreign aid as mutually beneficial with countries in the global south, promoting economic cooperation and increasing trade.\nU.S. foreign aid grants, Brazys says, also tended to focus on long-term solutions and came with conditions for governments, such as improving human rights, democracy and corruption.\nDolan's research in Kenya and Sierra Leone on the efficacy of Chinese aid showed mixed reactions from local medical officials, aid and health workers.\nHowever, it's clear that China will try to increase its influence through foreign aid, as the U.S presence appears to wane, she says.",
