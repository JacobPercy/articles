      "summary": "NEW DELHI \u2013 There is a method behind the apparent madness of US President Donald Trump\u2019s transactional, spheres-of-influence approach to geopolitics and the global economy.\nAt the same time, the US reserves the right to advance its strategic interests wherever it sees fit, including Greenland.\nCan carving up the world among major powers deliver a more stable and dynamic capitalism at a time when the global economy appears increasingly volatile and rudderless?\nRelative stability, such as it was, rested on a combination of overwhelming military power and a framework of global rules and institutions designed to keep geopolitical rivalries in check.\nDisputes over access, borders, and control are therefore inevitable when one power attempts to assert dominance on every front, raising the likelihood of major wars.",
